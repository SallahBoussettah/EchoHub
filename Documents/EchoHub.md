# 💬 EchoHub – AI Workspace for Freelancers and Creators

It uses AI to summarize client interactions, track progress, and generate insights — keeping you organized without switching tools.

## Problem

Freelancers constantly juggle between tools like Notion, Gmail, Trello, and Google Docs.  
This fragmentation causes lost messages, missed deadlines, and constant context switching.

- Client onboarding
- Proposal generation
- File & communication tracking
- AI-based project summaries and deadlines
- Smart reminders for follow-ups

All through one elegant, minimal interface.
