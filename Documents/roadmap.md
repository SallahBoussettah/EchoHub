## Key Principles

1. **Ship fast, iterate faster** – Launch with core features, improve based on real usage
2. **AI as enhancement, not replacement** – AI should augment human work, not replace it
3. **Privacy first** – User data is sacred; transparent policies and secure infrastructure
4. **Calm technology** – Reduce noise, increase signal; respect user attention
5. **Community-driven** – Build in public, listen to users, involve them in decisions

---

## Risk Mitigation

- **Competition**: Focus on freelancer-specific workflows, not generic project management
- **AI costs**: Implement smart caching, batch processing, and tiered AI features
- **User retention**: Build habit-forming features (daily summaries, smart reminders)
- **Technical complexity**: Start simple, add complexity only when validated by users
- **Monetization**: Offer generous free tier, but clear value in paid plans
